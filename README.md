# burger demo

Please, don't mind the project structure, as I just use some old project that I had for convenience.

Initially I was going with the web server approach, having an API, saving it in so repo, but then it seems that the focus was only on the component level.
So, in this example I made only the classes responsible for the decision when building a burger order.

It is built over flag system so new rules can be easily added without changing the code.
